    "ABSTRACT",
    "Sphingomonadaceae are common membrane colonizers and biofilm formers. As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly."

  "INTRO": [
    "ANNOUNCEMENT",
    "Widely used for drinking water, membrane filtration systems face biofouling due to microbe accumulation and biofilm formation. Studies reveal Sphingomonadaceae as common initial colonizers, persisting dominantly during biofilm growth (  ). Here, we report the genome sequence of a prevalent isolate.",
    "Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 was isolated from a biofilm on a Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane used for drinking water biofouling studies. Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to Sphingomonas sanguinis strains BAB-7166 (99%) and NBRC 13937 (99%) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods. However, the whole genome sequence (WGS) was not reported. WGS analysis is critical to uncover strain-specific traits associated with membrane biofouling. Here, we report the WGS of Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 using Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods.",
    "We received the Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 water isolate from Wetsus, Netherlands. Single isolated colonies were obtained on Reasoner’s 2A agar (R2A, Teknova R0005; Difco 214530) and cultured in R2A broth at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy UltraClean microbial kit (Qiagen 12224) following the company-provided protocol.",
    "Sequencing libraries were generated using Kapa’s Hyperplus kit (KK8514) and IDT adapters (#00989130v2). Quality was verified using an Agilent Tapestation and qPCR (NEBNext Library Quant Kit, E7630L) on Thermo Fisher’s Quantstudio5.",
    "Nineteen million 2 × 150 bp reads were obtained on a NovaSeq (Illumina) at Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core, with an average Phred score of 33–36 calculated by FastQC [v0.11.9 ].",
    "Assembly was performed with SPADES, default isolate settings [v3.15.2 ]. Contigs were aligned to NCBI databases with DIAMOND [v2.0.13 ]. Completeness was estimated using BUSCO [v5.2.2 ] proteobacteria marker genes. Of the 219 genes, there were 214 (97.7%) complete and single copy, 2 (0.9%) duplicated, 1 (0.5%) fragmented, and 2 (0.9%) missing.",
    "For species identification, average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated between all complete Sphingomonas genomes and Sph5 with PYANI [v0.2.11 ] and MUMMER [v4.0.0 ]. ANI scores between Sph5 and S. paucimobilis ranged from 99.77%–99.95%, while ANI between Sph5 and S. sanguinis was 87.74%.",
    "Annotations were predicted with Prokka [v1.14.6 ], given S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis references (Table 1), and used for orthogroup-based phylogeny construction with Orthofinder [v2.5.4 ], MAFFT [v7.490 ], and FastTree [v.2.1.10 ].",
    "The WGS phylogeny (Fig. 1) confirms that Sph5 is closest to S. paucimobilis while related to S. sanguinis. As a result, S. paucimobilis reference genomes were used for RagTag [v2.1.0 ] scaffolding of Sph5 contigs. ASM1602843v1 was the best scaffold (93.6% total length in three longest contigs of resulting assembly). Realignment of raw reads to ASM1602843v1-scaffolded Sph5 assembly with BWA [v0.7.17 ], SamTools [v1.12 ], and Picard [v2.25.0 ], evaluated by Mosdepth [v0.3.3 ], supports this (99.48% reads aligned, 1,089× coverage).",
    "Re-annotation with Prokka predicts 4,321 CDS, 3 rRNAs, 54 tRNAs, 1 tmRNA, and 1 repeat region. Of the CDS, 3,342 could be functionally annotated."
