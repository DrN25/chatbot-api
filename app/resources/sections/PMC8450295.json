  "ABSTRACT": [
    "Summary",
    "Measurements of telomere length in skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs), a rare cell population within muscles, provide insights into cellular dysfunction in diseased conditions. Here, we describe a protocol (cryosection muscle quantitative fluorescent in situhybridization) using skeletal muscle cryosections for assessments of telomere length in MuSCs, in their native environment. Using a free software, telomere length measurements are assessed on a single-cell level. We also provide methodology to perform data analyses in several ways.",

    "Before you begin",
    "Experimental design and considerations",
    "Note: This protocol utilizes skeletal muscle tissue from research animals and human cohorts. Ensure that the use of research animals has been approved by the appropriate institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC) or equivalent oversight body. Additionally, procurement and use of tissues derived from human sources should follow the appropriate organizational rules regarding informed consent and be approved by the end user’s institutional review board. Sample collection for this protocol was done according to institutional guidelines and regulations of the University of Pennsylvania.",
    "Note: For telomere data extraction from images, the following software must be installed on the analysis computer: java se (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and the freeware Telometer (https://demarzolab.pathology.jhmi.edu/telometer/download.html). Install software according to instructions listed on the websites.",
    "Reductions in telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) have been recently discovered in chronic muscle injury conditions, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which results in a more severe disease phenotype. Many common methods for conducting telomere length assessments in other cell and tissue types requires the isolation of primary cells, which may disrupt the tissue environment, requires large numbers of cells to obtain enough genomic DNA for appraisal [Telomere Restriction Fragment/TRF analysis ], or only provides the average telomere length over the entirety of the cell population [Telomere:single copy gene QPCR methodology ] . The quantitative fluorescent in-situ hybridization (Q-FISH) technique, which allows for assessment of telomere length based on the fluorescence intensity of a hybridized probe, coupled with semi-automated telomere length assessments using a free software (Telometer), provides robust information that can eliminate such limitations. Here, we provide a protocol where our previously established and validated muscle stem cell-specific Q-FISH protocol for measuring telomeres in FACS-isolated MuSCs [MuQ-FISH ], has been altered and adapted for use on cryosections of murine skeletal muscle (CRYO MuQ-FISH), leaving the MuSC niche intact. This method can be beneficial for telomere length quantitation of archival samples and may also be adapted to examine telomere lengths in additional muscle-resident cell types, as well as cell types from other tissues. This protocol is also compatible with skeletal muscle cryosections derived from species other than mice but testing and optimization should be conducted by the end user.",
    "This protocol includes the following steps: 1) Skeletal muscle preparation, embedding, sectioning, 2) CRYO MuQ-FISH, 3) image collection, 4) analysis and statistics",
    "Skeletal muscle preparation, embedding, and sectioning",
    "Timing: 2 days",
    "Humanely euthanize mice according to an approved IACUC protocol methodology and institutional guidelines.",
    "Note: This protocol uses male mice between 2 and 5 months of age. However, this protocol can be applied to samples derived from other ages and both sexes of mice.",
    "Spray the lower half of mouse body with 70% ethanol.",
    "Lay mouse on its back and completely remove skin from the back legs.",
    "Dissect desired hindlimb skeletal muscles for assessment.",
    "Note: For downstream assessments, it is ideal to compare the same types of muscles, rather than mixing different anatomical groups. We routinely utilize either the Tibialis anterior or the gastrocnemius muscles for telomere length measurements.",
    "Place isolated muscles in 3–4 mL of cold (4°C) 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS per well in a 6-well plate.",
    "Note: Tibialis anterior muscles up to 200 mg are fixed for 2 h, but larger muscles, such as the gastrocnemius, require a 3-h incubation for fixative to fully enter the tissue.",
    "Incubate tissue on a rocker at 4°C for at least 2 h.",
    "Remove muscles and place in pre-chilled 30% sucrose in water (4°C) overnight (16 h) at 4°C.",
    "Fix and process tissues for embedding.",
    "Label 15 mm × 15 mm × 5 mm base molds with pertinent mouse information with an alcohol resistant marker and mark directionality of the muscle by labeling the terminal tendon location.",
    "Fill base mold with O.C.T. to the point where it almost overflows from the inset. Do not allow bubbles to form. If they do, use a 100 μL micropipettor and tip to remove the bubbles.",
    "Place fixed muscle tissue in the base mold and push it evenly to the bottom of the mold. The orientation should be as it was labeled previously.",
    "Chill 2-methylbutane with dry ice or liquid nitrogen. Immerse muscles in base molds in chilled 2-methylbutane for >30 s for TA muscles and >1 min for gastrocnemius muscles.",
    "Place chilled blocks on dry ice for 1 h to allow residual 2-methylbutane to evaporate.",
    "Wrap blocks in base molds with parafilm and store at −80°C for at least overnight (16 h).",
    "Embed tissues in O.C.T. and freeze.",
    "Pause point: Cryoblocks can be stored at −80°C indefinitely.",
    "The evening before cryosectioning, remove cryoblocks from −80°C and place at −20°C.",
    "Label superfrost plus slides with pertinent mouse information.",
    "Note: For optimal adherence of sections, we firmly press cut sections onto room temperature (25°C) superfrost plus slides.",
    "Remove block from base mold and section in a cryostat, cutting 10 μm slices. We try to keep the tissue orientation the same for all blocks. Both longitudinal, as well as cross sectional slices will work with this assay.",
    "Store slides at −20°C until all samples have been collected and sectioned.",
    "Sectioning of skeletal muscles.",
    "Pause point: Slides can be stored at −20°C indefinitely."

We also examined the adaptability of this protocol to several other tissue types (spleen, liver, kidney, testicle, and colon) and found this protocol does appropriately label telomeres in all tissues examined (Figure 5), increasing the impact and usability of this method. However, in such tissues, it may be necessary to utilize thinner sections or more advanced microscopes (confocal microscopy), given the increased number of focal planes exhibiting telomere foci observed.",
    "Telomere length is measured using a semi-automated ImageJ-based platform known as Telometer. Telometer provides step-by step instructions to analyze 16-bit monochrome images for telomere length. The premise involves creating a project that is saved on a local machine, identifying cells of interest, and measuring the intensity of telomeres, relative to the total DAPI intensity of that cell. The readout from Telometer produces both total sum intensity of telomeres, which can be normalized to DAPI intensity to account for differences in cell cycle position, as well as the mean intensity of telomeres, which can also be normalized to DAPI. Should nuclear architecture or staining be compromised, telomere measurements can instead be normalized to centromere intensities. In this fashion, Telometer steps are conducted twice. Once, where the telomere signal is assessed relative to DAPI, and then those same cells of interest are analyzed a second time, where the centromere intensities are measured instead of the telomere intensities. The ratio of these measurements would then be used for dataset readouts.",
    "Expected outcomes",
    "This protocol demonstrates the methodology to process cryosections of skeletal muscle for telomere analysis. We utilized VCAM as a muscle stem cell marker; however, this protocol can likely be applied to additional resident skeletal muscle populations, once appropriate markers are identified and tested for compatibility. Here, we utilized data from two different genotypes of mice that underwent chronic, repetitive injuries, to demonstrate different ways to represent the data (Figure 3). Additionally, to confirm the validity of the CRYO MuQ-FISH method, we compared CRYO MuQ-FISH with our traditional MuQ-FISH method using isolated MuSCs. We found similar pattens of telomere shortening in a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy coupled with a telomere defect (Figure 6).",

  "DISCUSS": [
    "Limitations",
    "This protocol utilizes the quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization method for measuring telomere length. Because measurements of telomere length are based on fluorescent intensities, it is critical to image the slides as soon as possible, since fading will occur over time. Samples should not be imaged between different experiments, but instead they should only be imaged in the same batch in as short a time window as possible, since fluorescent intensities will be variable between experiments. Normalization must be done to respective control samples to combine datasets. Since MuSCs comprise a rare population of cells and are very small in size, a 100× or equivalent high-powered objective is necessary to visualize the telomere foci to get meaningful datasets.",
    "Troubleshooting",
    "Problem 1",
    "No Q-FISH telomere probe signal present following imaging (step 9).",
    "Potential solution",
    "Antigen retrieval time was insufficient or not completed with boiling buffer. Ensure that temperatures and times are completed as outlined in this protocol.",
    "Probe was bleached or stored improperly after being prepared. Always use a new aliquot of telomere/centromere probe from −80°C and ensure that it is protected from light throughout this protocol.",
    "Inappropriate dilution of probe was used, hybridization buffer was not correctly made, hybridization conditions were not followed. If probes are too dilute, increase the amount of the Q-FISH probes used in the protocol. Confirm that hybridization buffer is completely dissolved and that no air bubbles were present when hybridization occurred. Confirm the heating source during denaturation and hybridization is at the proper temperatures.",
    "Problem 2",
    "High background staining (step 9).",
    "Potential solution",
    "Do not let the tissue dry out at any step following permeabilization. Avoid Cy3/Alexa fluor red/orange dyes except for centromeric region staining.",
    "Problem 3",
    "Large numbers of samples that cannot be imaged in the required timeframe (step 10d).",
    "Potential solution",
    "While imaging samples in the same time window is optimal, if too many samples are present, a 3-day window may not be sufficient time to complete the acquisition, resulting in fading of the sample and alteration of the data. To overcome this caveat, it may be possible to normalize the intensity of a particular reference sample imaged on different days using fluorescent beads, such as those found in the InSpeck Microscopy Image Intensity Calibration Kit. These kits contain beads of varying but defined intensities from which a standard curve can be generated on each day within the same experiment.",
    "Problem 4",
    "Telometer is not displaying recorded datasets (step 25d).",
    "Potential solution",
    "Ensure that you are trying to view data in the appropriate project file. It may be necessary to use the “refresh” button to repopulate the project file, particularly if one is trying to view data that was accumulated since Telometer was first opened.",
    "Problem 5",
    "DAPI staining intensity is not consistent between experimental groups or nuclear architecture is dissimilar (step 26).",
    "Potential solution",
    "Conduct telomere analysis by normalizing to a centromeric probe. First do telomere analysis normalized to DAPI. Then repeat the Telometer analysis on the same cells using the centromere image instead of the telomere image. Ensure to label cells of interest in the same order between the telomere identification and the centromere identification. Finally, divide the Telomere sum/DAPI sum percent by the Centromere sum/DAPI sum. Utilize those values for graphing.",
    "Problem 6",
    "Inconsistent data between experiments (step 27).",
    "Potential solution",
    "Given that Q-FISH is an intensity-based measurement, experimental samples are ideally measured at the same time with the same exposure settings. If too many samples are present, fading can occur between sample sets that would confound downstream analysis. Thus, it is optimal to image all experimental groups as soon as possible, and comparisons between different experiments are not possible. Additionally, telomere probe in hybridization buffer should completely cover the sample without any air bubbles. While the values themselves may be different, due to inherent differences between experimental preparations, calculations of percent difference between groups can be useful in confirming that datasets are similar."
