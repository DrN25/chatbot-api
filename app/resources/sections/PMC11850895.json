  "INTRO": [
    "Introduction",
    "Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission.",
    "Plants are characterized by lack of a nervous system but still have the ability to systematically communicate the environmental signals from the site of perception to the distal tissues. In response to herbivorous insect attack or wounding at local leaves, wound signaling molecules are released at the damaged plant cells, and may bind corresponding receptors to trigger propagation of slow wave potentials (SWPs), initiate transmission of cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt), and consequently activate biosynthesis of defensive phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA), thereby mediating expression of defense-responsive genes for systemic defense responses in plants.",
    "Many different types of chemical substances were revealed as neurotransmitters that induce long-distance ionic responses to effectively mediate neurotransmission in mammals. However, in plant kingdom, only an amino acid and a protein, namely the glutamate (Glu) and the recently discovered “Ricca’s factor” β-THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE (TGG) are so far defined as wound signals that depend on glutamate receptor-like (GLR) protein, the homologous protein of mammalian ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs), to activate systemic plant defense response. In this study, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identified a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that highly accumulated Glu, the previously defined molecule crucial for activation of plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibited attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncovered GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance propagation of calcium-based defense signaling events."

    "Results",
    "Identification of GSH as a signaling molecule that activates long-distance plant defense signaling events",
    "During the genetic screening of the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), we identified a mutant, termed hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B. cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1). A single gene AT4G23100 was identified with PCR analysis on the mutant genomic DNA.",
    "To further verify that the decreased resistance in the hr-52 mutant is caused by the interference with AT4G23100 gene, we obtained the previously reported mutant pad2-1 with the Ser298Asn substitution (S298N) within AT4G23100 to assess its responses to B. cinerea infection and insect attack. The results showed that pad2-1 exhibited severe susceptibility to B. cinerea and Spodoptera exigua, a globally agricultural pest, while genetic transformation of pad2-1 with PAD2 (AT4G23100) completely restored the resistance (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). Our results together with the previous findings demonstrate that AT4G23100 gene is essential for plant defense response against B. cinerea infection and insect attack.",
    "It was known that the AT4G23100 gene encodes the gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase catalyzing the reaction between Glu and cysteine for generation of glutamylcysteine in the GSH biosynthesis pathway. We found that a high level of Glu (875.42 μg/g FW) was accumulated in the pad2-1 mutant compared to WT (494.96 μg/g FW) while the GSH content in pad2-1 (4.91 μg/g FW) was severely decreased to 5.9% of WT (82.94 μg/g FW) (Fig. 1a, b). It is surprising that such a high level of Glu failed to induce plant defense in pad2-1 (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), which seems to be inconsistent with the previously defined role of Glu as a critical wound signal that activates plant defense response. The observed susceptibility in the GSH-deficient pad2-1 mutant suggests an indispensable role for GSH in plant defense, which encourages us to further investigate whether GSH acts as wound signal to trigger long distance calcium-based defense signaling events.",
    "To verify the role of GSH in activating long-distance plant defense signaling events, we wounded leaf 1 of pad2-1 and Col-0, and then measured the accumulation of wound-induced plant defensive hormonal molecules in leaf 6, considering that leaf n shares direct vascular connections with leaves n ± 5 and n ± 8 while leaves n ± 3 may represent contact parastichies formed by proximal but unconnected vasculature in adult Arabidopsis rosettes. Consistent with the reduced plant resistance in pad2-1, the defensive phytohormone jasmonates were obviously decreased in the leaf 6 of pad2-1 to ~63.04% (for JA) and ~45.81% (for JA-Ile) of those in Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, the expression of JA-inducible defense marker genes OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ7 was also significantly attenuated in leaf 6 of pad2-1 compared to Col-0 upon wounding leaf 1 (Fig. 1e). These results suggest that GSH might serve as a critical signaling molecule essential for activation of plant systemic defense signaling events.",
    "To further explore the underlying mechanism of GSH in activating systemic plant defense responses, we introduced the [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 into pad2-1, generating GCaMP3/pad2-1 plant, to investigate whether the GSH-deficient mutant attenuated the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission. Upon mechanical wounding of leaf 1, both amplitude and kinetics of [Ca2+]cyt propagation in leaf 6 were reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 compared with GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 1f, g; Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). The peak value of [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence changes in leaf 6 of GCaMP3/pad2-1 was reduced to ~44.15% of that in GCaMP3 (Fig. 1h). Consistently, the percentage of each systemic leaf that showed apparent increased [Ca2+]cyt fluorescence was reduced in GCaMP3/pad2-1 (Fig. 1i). These data reinforce the role of GSH in triggering the wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants.",
    "Taken together, the above-mentioned data suggest that GSH might serve as an important wound signal that triggers wound-induced systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission, activates JA biosynthesis, and regulates plant defense responses.",
    "GSH triggers long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission",
    "To further validate that GSH acts as a wound signal triggering long-distance plant defense signaling events, we applied GSH (with Glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively) to leaf 1 of the GCaMP3 plants and visualized the systemic [Ca2+]cyt in the whole seedlings (Fig. 2a, b). Intriguingly, the fast and transient increase of [Ca2+]cyt was notably triggered in systemic leaves (including leaf 3, 4, and 6) by GSH (Supplementary Movie 3) at the level comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2a). Specifically, [Ca2+]cyt rapidly increased to the peak value in leaf 6 at ~230 s upon treatment on leaf 1 with GSH rather than sorbitol (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 4), and more distal leaves showed [Ca2+]cyt propagation with the increased GSH concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with the Ca2+ channel inhibitor LaCl3 (Fig. 2e-g). To exclude the possibility that GSH is cleaved by enzymes to release glutamate for Ca²⁺ signal propagation, we employed GGsTop, a well-known chemical inhibitor that specifically targets gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), the enzyme responsible for converting GSH to Glu. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in the Ca²⁺ signaling response when GSH was used in combination with GGsTop compared to that of GSH treatment alone (Supplementary Fig. 6), suggesting that GSH was not converted to Glu for activation of systemic Ca2+ signaling. Additionally, we synthesized another tripeptide (Glu-Pro-Ala), which contains glutamate along with two different amino acids, and investigated its effects in triggering systemic Ca2+ signal propagation in plants. Unlike GSH treatment, application of Glu-Pro-Ala failed to induce long-distance transmission of Ca²⁺ signal in plants (Supplementary Fig. 7), reinforcing the role of GSH as a signaling molecule that effectively triggers systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation in plants.",
    "Consistently, GSH application on leaf 1 significantly induced the expression of defense-responsive genes (OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10) in leaf 6 (by ~5.6, ~8.6 and ~5.7 folds), which is comparable to that induced by Glu (Fig. 2d). Moreover, pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with LaCl3 severely reduced the GSH-inducible expression of defense genes in systemic leaves (Fig. 2h), verifying that propagation of [Ca2+]cyt is required for GSH-induced defense gene expression. Collectively, these results demonstrate that GSH acts as an important wound signal in triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.",
    "GSH activates the transcriptional expression of defense-related genes in plant systemic leaves",
    "To get deeper insights into the GSH-triggered systemic defense signaling events in plants, we performed transcriptome profiling on leaf 6 collected after 1  h application of GSH to leaf 1 of WT plants. We identified 378 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the systemic leaf of GSH-treated plants compared to non-stimulated mock control plants (Supplementary Data 1). Among them, 354 genes including a large number of key defense-responsive genes were upregulated while 24 genes were downregulated (Fig. 3a), which is well consistent with the tendency of transcriptome data from plants in response to wounding, namely, more transcripts are upregulated than downregulated. Gene Ontology analysis (GO) of these DEGs further revealed significant enrichment of terms associated with plant defense signaling, including defense response, cellular responses to JA, response to wounding, and response to hormone (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 2). Consistent with the transcriptome analysis, qRT-PCR also showed that expression of defense marker genes (CYP94C1, JAZ13, LOX4, OPR3, JAZ5, JAZ7, and JAZ10) was highly induced in the systemic leaf tissues of GSH-treated plants (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Fig. 8). These data provide an overview of the GSH-induced gene expression in plant systemic leaf tissues and further indicate the important role of GSH in triggering plant long-distance defense signaling.",
    "To further investigate the relations between GSH and Glu in plant wound response, we generated transcriptome data sets from leaf 6 1 h after wounding leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 3) or application of Glu to leaf 1 (Supplementary Data 4), and then compared these data to that induced by GSH. This comparison showed that 207 DEGs were co-regulated by wounding and GSH treatment, while 228 DEGs were found in both GSH and Glu treatment groups. Moreover, a total of 267 DEGs from GSH- and Glu-treated groups existed in wounding treatment, among which 126 genes were co-regulated by GSH, Glu and wounding, 81 genes were only regulated by GSH and wounding, and 60 genes were only regulated by Glu and wounding (Fig. 3e). These overlapped genes which are co-regulated by GSH, Glu, and wounding or independently regulated by GSH and wounding, Glu and wounding are all mainly involved in plant defense signaling, including plant response to wounding, stress, JA, and biotic stimulus, regulation of cell communication, and innate immune response, suggesting that GSH and Glu are involved in wound-induced plant systemic defense response.",
    "GLR3.3 is required for GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt propagation",
    "GLR proteins which generally contain an amino-terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a transmembrane domain (TMD), and a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), have broad agonist profiles including glycine, cysteine, methionine, Glu and GSH. Specially, Glu-triggered long-distance [Ca2+]cyt propagation is dramatically inhibited in glr3.3glr3.6 mutant. To figure out whether GSH-triggered long-distance calcium signaling depends on GLR3.3 and GLR3.6, we compared the GSH-triggered Ca2+-related signaling events among the glr3.3, glr3.6 and WT plants containing the GCaMP3 reporter (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig. 9). Interestingly, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was severely reduced in the GCaMP3/glr3.3 (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 4). However, the GSH-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission was not markedly attenuated in GCaMP3/glr3.6, which is similar to that of GCaMP3 plant (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Movie 5). Consistently, the GSH-inducible expression of defense marker gene OPR3, JAZ5, and JAZ10 was significantly repressed in the GCaMP3/glr3.3, but not obviously inhibited in the GCaMP3/glr3.6 and the GCaMP3 plants (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that GLR3.3 plays a dominant role in regulating GSH-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation. Similar to the systemic calcium signal transmission upon GSH treatment, Glu-induced [Ca2+]cyt propagation in systemic leaves were strongly inhibited in GCaMP3/glr3.3 while remained unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10), confirming that Glu-induced long-distance calcium wave is also dependent on GLR3.3.",
    "To characterize the interaction between GLR3.3 and GSH, the predicted structure of GLR3.3 was used to perform molecular docking. The binding model showed that Glu binds to the LBD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3LBD) (Supplementary Fig. 11), which is consistent with the recent report about the Glu binding to the GLR3.3LBD. While GSH was predicted to bind the ATD of GLR3.3 (referred to as GLR3.3ATD), which is remarkably different from Glu in terms of binding domains and contacting amino acids (Supplementary Fig. 11). Consistent with the predicted interaction between GLR3.3ATD and GSH (Supplementary Fig. 11), recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data revealed that GSH binds the ATD of GLR3.4, another GLR protein with high sequence similarity to GLR3.3, reinforcing that GSH might bind the ATD domain of GLR3.3 for activation of ion channel. Together with the genetic evidence showing GLR3.3 is required for both GSH- and Glu-triggered systemic [Ca2+]cyt transmission (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. 10), these results collectively suggest that GSH and Glu may bind to different domains of GLR3.3 for activating ion channel activity and triggering leaf-to-leaf, calcium-based plant defense signaling.",
    "Taken together, our results shown in Figs. 1–4 suggest that GSH serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance propagation of [Ca2+]cyt waves in a GLR3.3-dependent manner, thus inducing rapid JA biosynthesis in systemic leaf organs to protect plants from herbivory ahead of time."

    "Discussion",
    "Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. Due to lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to systemically deliver the wound signal from the site of injured organs to the distal undamaged tissues, which helps them be well-prepared for upcoming dangers. In this study, we find that the GSH-deficient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated Glu previously defined as a critical wound signal essential for activating plant defense events, showed impaired plant defense signaling events (Fig. 1; Supplementary Figs. 1-3). We further define GSH as a critical wound signal that depends on GLR3.3 to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling in plants (Figs. 2–4; Supplementary Figs. 5-11). Intriguingly, in the animal nervous system, GSH has been identified as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter, suggesting a potential conceptual parallel in GSH-mediated signal transmission across different kingdoms of life. Moreover, we noticed that GSH and Glu induced distinct [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns in systemic leaves. Specifically, the spread of systemic [Ca2+]cyt triggered by GSH is preferentially initiated from marginal veins and rapidly transmitted to the mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 6), whereas Glu mediated [Ca2+]cyt transmission mainly propagated from mid veins to marginal veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 7). Re-examination of the data shown in the previous study revealing Glu as a wound signal also supports our observation that Glu triggers [Ca2+]cyt transmission with the direction of mid-to-marginal veins. Intriguingly, the transmission pattern of wounding-induced [Ca2+]cyt contained both directions of the mid-to-marginal veins and the marginal-to-mid veins (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Movie 8). Future work to elucidate the mechanisms and biological significance of different [Ca2+]cyt transmission patterns induced by GSH and Glu would help us to further understand the highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against insect attack.",
    "When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the JA signaling pathway in whole plant tissues, which in turn mediates the systemic defense responses against insects. In our study, we defined GSH as a critical wound signal to trigger long-distance [Ca2+]cyt transmission for activation of JA biosynthesis in distal organs, thereby inducing plant systemic defense response (Figs. 1–4). Interestingly, as shown in our transcriptome data, in addition to the pronounced enrichment of genes associated with JA signaling in systemic leaf tissues after GSH treatment, genes responsive to other defense phytohormones such as ethylene and salicylic acid, which are responsible for plant resistance to pathogen infection, are also highly upregulated (Supplementary Data 1), implying that GSH might also act as a signaling molecule to activate the plant systemic immune response. Previously recognized as an antioxidant, GSH is intricately linked with reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Our transcriptome analysis also revealed that genes responsive to oxidative stress were significantly induced in the systemic leaf tissues following GSH treatment (Supplementary Data 1). Given that both calcium and ROS signals play a role in mediating plant systemic defense responses to wounding, exploring the potential involvement of ROS in GSH-triggered systemic defense response would be interesting.",
    "Wound-induced systemic defense signaling requires the involvement of GLR ion channel proteins, such as GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. Our study found that the GSH-triggered long-distance calcium-mediated defense response was suppressed in GCaMP3/glr3.3 but nearly unaffected in GCaMP3/glr3.6 (Fig. 4). Similar to GSH, it was also observed that Glu depends on GLR3.3 rather than GLR3.6 to initiate the systemic calcium-based defense signaling (Supplementary Fig. 10). Considering the recent X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, which revealed that GSH and Glu could bind to different domains of GLR3.4 for ion channel activation, it would be intriguing to investigate whether GSH binds to GLR3.3 and further determine the potential relationship between GSH and Glu in activating GLR3.3. Furthermore, in contrast to GSH and Glu, the recently identified Ricca’s factor TGGs, was shown to rely on both GLR3.6 and GLR3.3 to trigger the systemic defense response. It would be exciting to further uncover the signal interactions among Glu, TGGs, and GSH in wound-induced systemic defense signaling. Given that various chemical substances have been identified as neurotransmitters/neuromodulators in mammals, eliciting long-distance ionic responses that effectively mediate neurotransmission, identification of more systematic signaling molecules in the future would offer new insights into the complex systemic defense signaling in plants.",
    "The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals (neurotransmitters) and electrical signals, where ion fluxes are induced by neurotransmitters and the release of neurotransmitters is dependent on electrical signals. In contrast, little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long-distance signaling. Previous studies suggest that the dispersal of elicitors such as Glu may rely on bulk flow and diffusion. Given that GSH has a molecular weight similar to that of amino acids, a plausible scenario is that when plants experience mechanical damage or insect attack, a large volume of GSH from the intracellular region may surge into the apoplastic region, inducing calcium influx by activation of the GLR3.3 ion channel. With the action of diffusion and bulk flow of GSH within the vascular bundles, calcium signals can be rapidly transmitted between leaves. In addition to the diffusion and bulk flow theory, other theories have also been proposed, such as the osmoelectric siphon model, which is based on membrane depolarization leading to cell water shedding into the apoplast followed by membrane repolarization and water uptake. More recently, osmotic pressure has been suggested to induce the systemic apoplastic release of signaling molecules like Glu. Future studies aimed at uncovering the potential mechanisms underlying GSH-triggered systemic Ca2+ signal transmission would be fascinating."
